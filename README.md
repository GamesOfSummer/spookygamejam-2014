##EO - Spooky Game Jam 2014

Game written in two days in 2014 - simply download and run it in your browser by opening the index.html. Uses ImpactJS.

**Warning **- It has a jump scare in it. It's also generally unsettling.

All code and art was done by me. Sounds were found on free websites like FreeSound.Org.
